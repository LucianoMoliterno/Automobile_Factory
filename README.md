Database integrator job 1

An automotive terminal company (car factory) hired me to computerize your business. Its operations are carried out as follows: The terminal is dedicated to assembling automobiles, that is, he buys the different auto parts (engine, tires, tires, doors, etc.) to different suppliers and with them he proceeds to paint, assemble and vehicle test.
In an assembly line, a single model of vehicle is manufactured, the factory has as many assembly lines as vehicle models are manufactured; capacity is also known
average production of each assembly line (in vehicles per month).
Each of the assembly lines is made up of several work stations according to required by each model. At each station, a single specific task is performed, such as
example: painting, sheet metal assembly, motor mechanics, filming mechanics, electricity and testing, where in these tasks a series of inputs are consumed, which are provided by different companies. It is known how much of these inputs is needed for each model of vehicle (liters of paint, meters of cable, covers, lamps, etc.) A supplier company can
manufacture more than one input and for more than one season. In addition, the same input can be provided by more than one company.
At the time production starts, each car is assigned a production number. 
chassis that identifies it. The date and time the vehicle enters and exits each station, in order to know the time it took to produce a complete vehicle and to be able to carry productivity statistics for each station and each assembly line.
The company works in the determined way “Just in time” (just in time). 
This implies that does not keep large stocks of the parts needed to build a vehicle, but rather makes orders from their suppliers on a weekly basis.
The terminal has a series of concessionary companies, which are the ones dedicated to selling manufactured vehicles. These concessionaires report sales to the terminal
made and the terminal informs them of the expected delivery date. This delivery date will depend on the number of orders that the company has to date and the capacity of
production of each assembly line plus one week for any unforeseen event. 
Each production input has a code that identifies it, a description and a price.
The price is set by each of the providers, with which, according to the provider, the same input may have different price.
